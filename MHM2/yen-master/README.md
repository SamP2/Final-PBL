If you've wanted to address a mental health issue but have been hesitant to do so in person, simple software that is meant to help you navigate your mental health journey and take the uncertainty out of obtaining the help you need.

Yen in VNmese means an array of things from "peace" and "safe" to "stand still". Whether you need soothing reminders to mindfulness or you want to reflect your inner tranquility, this simple name will do it all.

## How we built it
This project has been built with a lot of love, consideration to help others with their mental health and Python, using:
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
- [Bootstrap Component](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com)
- Calendar JS
- [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
- SQLite

## Challenges we ran into
In our team, there's only one member that knows how to use flask and one other that knows how to use figma. It takes us a while to learn both of those to comprehensively create the website.
